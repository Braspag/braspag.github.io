# What is Cart達o Protegido?

The **Cart達o Protegido** is a platform that enables secure storage of credit and debit cards. We have a fully certified environment by the respected PCI Security Standards Council, which ensures that Braspag fully follows the strict requirements and standards determined by it.

The platform is compatible with Braspag's Pagador gateway, facilitating the processing of credit and debit card transactions via token.
